\section{Renaming and simplify}
While BNFC is a great tool to create a parse tree from raw text the resulting 
tree structure is very verbose with a lot of constructors. To simplify this a
renamer step is introduced in the pipeline. This step converts the parse tree
to our minimally designed abstract syntax tree or AST for short. 

% I want these beside each other and a arrow in between
\begin{lstlisting} 
f = if a                      f = case a of
      then b        =>              True  -> b
      else c                        False -> c
\caption{Simple transformation to a more general form}
\label{lst:renamer1}
\end{lstlisting}

In this step a few grammar rules could be translated to more general expressions
to simplify the AST and lessen the cases the typechecker need to cover, see
table \ref{lst:renamer1}.

The other part of the renamer module is to annotate the functions to where they
where exported from...
