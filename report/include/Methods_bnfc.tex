\section{Parsing source code} \label{sec:bnfc}
Similar to a normal language is a programming language built from a grammar. 
From this grammar a lexer is produced. The lexers job is to match a word in the
source code to a token in the grammar. For example in english the word train 
would match a noun token. 

The next step is to combine all these tokens to expressions or sentences. This
is done with a parser. To make the language as expressive as possible you build
up bigger expressions out of smaller expressions. This will create a tree
structure that will be easier to work with instead of raw text. 

To remove a lot of work the lexer and parser can be automatically generated from
a tool when written grammar in Backus-Naur-form or BNF. This BNF converter, or
BNFC for short, is developed by Chalmers and used in earlier courses(plt ref here).
This made it an easy choise with the groups familarity with the tool.
