\section{Code revision control}

When developing the Hopper language and its compiler Git was used for code revision control.
Revision control systems enables development using several. Furthermore, Git (and most other
revision control systems) offer branching. Branching is a method of realizing a non-linear
development history, and can be used for testing different solutions in parallel without
disturbing other contributers work. Due to the project's experimental nature, Git was the
chosen revision control system for its branching functionality.
