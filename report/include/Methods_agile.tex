\section{Development process}

The development used for implementing the project was a derivation of Scrum \cite{Scrum}. The project
was devided into short sprints. Each sprint was planned at its start, and the length of
the sprints spanned from one to two weeks, depending on the estimated work load. A list
of task constituted the sprints goal, and each member was assigned one or more goals
that said member would be responsible for. Each member then directed the design,
implementation and testing of its responsible area throughout the sprint, either alone or
with help from other members of the group if needed. Sprints were then closed during an
evaluation process held during weekly meetings.
