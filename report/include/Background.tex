% WHAT IS A COMPILER 

To allow for a higher abstraction and higher thinking when resoning about 
algorithms new language has be developed. To be able to run these new languages
compilers has been built to "translate" the code down to machine code to run 
directly or to a lower level language to make use of their compiler. 

% HOW IS A COMPILER BUILT 

When building a compiler it can be resembled to a pipe where text flows through 
while transformed into different representations and in the end outputted
to runnable code to either run on the computer itself or on a virtual machine
that emulates a computer.

Now is Hopper really a transpiler or a translating compiler. Instead of 
outputting runnable code it outputs other code that is interpreted and compiled
by the Erlang compiler, erlc. With this the project could very much be 
simplified (ref to read more in discussion).
