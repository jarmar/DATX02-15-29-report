% WHAT IS A COMPILER 

To allow for a higher abstraction and higher level of resoning about 
algorithms new language has been developed. To be able to run these new languages
compilers has been built to "translate" the code down to machine code to run 
directly on hardware or to a lower level language to make use of their compiler. 

% HOW IS A COMPILER BUILT 

When building a compiler it can be resembled to a pipe where text flows through 
while transformed into different representations and in the end outputted
to runnable code to either run on the computer itself or on a virtual machine
that emulates a computer. 

In figure ~\ref{fig:generalpipeline} you can see how the source flows through.
It should be noted that the typechecker is optional for a language. It can
fully rely on the grammar to expose errors, this will lead to a more expressive 
language while it may crash in execution due to type errors.

Now is Hopper really a transpiler or a translating compiler. Instead of 
outputting runnable code it outputs other code that is interpreted and compiled
by the Erlang compiler, erlc. With this the project could very much be 
simplified (ref to read more in discussion).
