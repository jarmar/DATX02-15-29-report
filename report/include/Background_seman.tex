\section{Semantic analysis}

what
  in general
    a step in the compilation process
    examine details of the code which cannot be captured be the grammar itself.
    example control flow analysis
  type inference
    a formal system
    system F in Haskell
    we use Hindley-Milner type system to begin with

why
  in general
    prove properties
    show correctness/show absence of errors
  type inference
    tractable
    well established

how
  preprocess
    the simple language
    transformations
  type inference
    generating constraints by inference rules
    solving constraints by solving rules
  postprocess
    looking upp the solved types and reporting them
