\section{Type checker}

The type checker implements a version of the Hindley-Milner type system, allowing one to define polymorphic functions such as
map and fold. A function for granting access to Erlang bifs, Prim.apply, was implemented in the Erlang module Prim.erl and had its type hardcoded into the typechecker. Prim.apply makes it possible to use any Erlang function in a typesafe manner.
