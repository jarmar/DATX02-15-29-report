% consider not using "among others" and "and others" (replace one of them with som other word)?

Core Erlang \cite{CoreErlangIntro} is an intermediate language in the Erlang compilation suite, mainly used for simplifiying operation on Erlang source code. Such operations can be parsing, compiling, debugging and others. Some of the main purposes of Core Erlang are to be as regular as possible, provide clear and simple semantics, among others. The language is since release 8 an official part of the OTP/Open Source Erlang Distribution.

BEAM is the name of the Erlang virtual machine. Erlang and Core Erlang source code may be compiled to .beam files, which contain instructions from the BEAM instruction set. These instructions are interpreted by the virtual machine at run time.
