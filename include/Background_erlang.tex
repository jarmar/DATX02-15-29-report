\section{Core Erlang and BEAM}

Core Erlang \cite{CoreErlangIntro} is an intermediate language in the Erlang compilation suite, mainly used for simplifying operations on Erlang source code. Such operations can include, but are not limited to: parsing, compiling and debugging. Some of the main purposes of Core Erlang are to be as regular as possible and to provide clear and simple semantics. The language is since release 8, released in 2001, an official part of the OTP/Open Source Erlang Distribution.

\Gls{beam} is the name of the Erlang virtual machine. Erlang and Core Erlang source code may be compiled to \texttt{.beam} files, which contain assembler instructions for the \gls{beam} virtual machine. These instructions are interpreted by the virtual machine at run time.
