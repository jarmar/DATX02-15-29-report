In BNFC the layout functionality isn't very much explained. What we had to do to understand this was to look at examples and the BNFC source code and generated source code for our parser. This was difficult and we still don't have full understanding of when the layout rule is activated but we suppose it is similar how other layout parsers does it. % This is just fill out text that doesn't mean much
