\section{Grammar}

Using the \gls{bnfc} to generate a lexer and parser from our grammar was overall very successful. BNFC had all the features wanted for implementing the product. It halved the work by producing both a lexer and a parser which would otherwise had to be written separately from scratch. It also had indentation sensitivity built in which is great but the group still does not have full understanding of all cases in which the layout rule is activated. To mitigate this one can override the layout rule to check if the specified grammar still behaves correctly. 

The rewrite done half way through the project temporarily held up the introduction of new features. It was a necessary change however; new syntax could not otherwise have been added without ambiguity.
