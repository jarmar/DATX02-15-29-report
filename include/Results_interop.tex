\section{Interoperability}

\todo{it would be nice to mention somewhere that interoperability with type safety would require some way to declare the type of an imported erlang function, i.e. some kind of FFI declaration}

The fact that the Hopper compiler generates BEAM modules allows for a degree of interoperability: Hopper modules may be integrated in applications written in Erlang. Some parts of the compiler are prepared for enabling Hopper code to make use of modules written using Erlang. This would enable Hopper written code to access the already established Erlang library, and opens up for a future where Hopper written libraries may be accessed in Erlang written applications.
