\section{Interoperability}

The fact that the Hopper compiler generates BEAM modules allows for a degree of interoperability; Hopper modules may be integrated with modules written in Erlang, and vice versa. This enables Hopper written code to access the already established Erlang library, and opens up for a future where Hopper written libraries may be accessed in Erlang written applications.
