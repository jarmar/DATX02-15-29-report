\section{Dependency checking}

\todo{Assigned Jakob}

As computer programs increase in complexity, a need for separation of concerns arises. Programming languages typically solve this problem by having a concept of \emph{modules} (sometimes also known as \emph{packages}), cohesive units of code. Besides the organizational benefits, there are technical merits to modular software as well. If a single module is changed, the entire project doesn't necessarily have to be recompiled -- only the parts which \emph{depend} on the module that was changed.

The concept of \emph{dependency} is central in module systems. Most\todo{sources} languages require dependencies between modules to be explicitly declared (e.g. with \texttt{import} statements or similar), but concepts differ between different languages. For example, some languages allow cyclical intermodule dependencies while others forbid it. \todo{fill out}
