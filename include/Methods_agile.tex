\section{Development process}

The development process used for the project was a derivation of Scrum \cite{Scrum}. The project was divided into short sprints with each sprint being planned at its start. Sprint lengths spanned from one to two weeks depending on the estimated work load. During the planning phase of a sprint each member was assigned one or more goals that they would be responsible for. The members then directed the design, implementation and testing of their areas of responsibility throughout the sprint, either alone or with help from other members of the group. Sprints were then closed after an evaluation process held during weekly meetings. 

Some scrum characteristics were left out, for example the appointment of a scrum master and a daily meeting. Sprint review and planning was carried out during the weekly meetings with few intermediate whole group activities.
