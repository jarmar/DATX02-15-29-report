\section{Development process}

The development process used for the project was a derivation of Scrum \cite{Scrum}. The project
was divided into short sprints with each sprint being planned at its start. Length of sprints 
spanned from one to two weeks depending on the estimated work load.
A list of tasks constituted the sprint goals and each member was assigned one or more goals
that said member would be responsible for. Each member then directed the design,
implementation and testing of their areas of responsibility throughout the sprint, either alone or
with help from other members of the group if needed. Sprints were then closed during an
evaluation process held during weekly meetings. Some scrum characteristics left out was appointment of a scrum master and some version of a daily scrum or continuous communication outside of weekly meetings. The weekly meetings became sprint review and sprint planning with few intermediate whole group activities.
