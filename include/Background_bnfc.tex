\section{Parsing source code} \label{sec:bnfc}

\todo{Assigned David}

Similar to a spoken language is a programming language built from a grammar. But different from a spoken language is a programming language's grammar exact. This come from that a spoken language's grammar is a construction in retrospect and also that it does not always follow the rules.

\todo{mention that programming language grammar is (more) strict and exact} 
A programming language's grammar needs to be exact for it to be able to not allow syntax that it can't produce output for. 

The grammar describes ways in which the smaller pieces of the language can be put together to form bigger ones, often with more meaning. From this grammar a lexer is produced. The lexers job is to match all words in the source code to tokens in the grammar. For example in english the word 'train' would match a noun token. 

The next step is to combine all these tokens to expressions or sentences. This is done with a parser. To make the language as expressive as possible you build up bigger expressions out of smaller expressions. This will create a tree structure that will be easier to work with. 

To save a lot of work the lexer and parser can be automatically generated from a tool when the grammar is written in Backus-Naur-form or BNF. This BNF converter, or BNFC for short \todo{maybe glossary}, is developed at Chalmers and used in earlier courses in earlier courses meaning that the group members was already famililar with the tool (plt ref here).
