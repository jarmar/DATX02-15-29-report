\section{Parsing source code} \label{sec:bnfc}
Similar to a normal language a programming language is built from a grammar.
The grammar describes ways in which the smaller pieces of the language can be put
together to form bigger ones, often with more meaning.
From this grammar a lexer is produced. The lexers job is to match all words in the
source code to tokens in the grammar. For example in english the word train 
would match a noun token. 

The next step is to combine all these tokens to expressions or sentences. This
is done with a parser. To make the language as expressive as possible you build
up bigger expressions out of smaller expressions. This will create a tree
structure that will be easier to work with. 

To save a lot of work the lexer and parser can be automatically generated from
a tool when the grammar is written in Backus-Naur-form or BNF. This BNF converter, or
BNFC for short, is developed by Chalmers and used in earlier courses meaning that
the group members was already famililar with the tool (plt ref here).
