\section{Future work}

To ensure that the Hopper language and its compiler develops into a useful product, work beyond what was done in this project needs to be laid out. The next step that was planned in the project but not fulfilled was the support for accessing the concurrency features of Erlang. Experimental work done during the project was carried out and it showed that access to the concurrency features can be given with ease, however the implementation needs to be finalized. After this, a thorough clean up of the code should take place together with fixes of the known bugs, and a robust and quality ensuring test suite should be implemented. When this is done, Hopper will have a stable foundation that will open up for future additions and improvements such as descriptive error messages, compile time optimizations and a richer library of built in functions.
