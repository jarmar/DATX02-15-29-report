\section{Algebraic data types}

\Glspl{adt} are types composed by other types, and are often used to define complex data structures. The values of \glspl{adt} are created using constructors. Constructors take zero or more arguments and return a composite value containing the given values in the defined structure. Such a composition may then be deconstructed and analyzed, typically using pattern matching. An \gls{adt} may have several constructors with different combinations of data, and may also be recursive. This provides a simple but powerful way of expressing rich data structures.

\todo{compare to object orientation, mathematical meaning? Pattern matching, short. Defined in an abstract way. Think I need help with finalizing this topic}
