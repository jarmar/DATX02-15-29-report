\section{Algebraic data types}

\Glspl{adt} are types composed by other types, and are often used for building complex data structures. The values of \glspl{adt} are created using constructors. Constructors take zero or more arguments and then return a record containing the values in the defined structure. Such a record may then be deconstructed and analyzed, typically using pattern matching.
