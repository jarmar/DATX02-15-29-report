\section{Algebraic data types}

\Glspl{adt} are types composed using constructors, and are often used to define complex data structures. Constructors take zero or more arguments and return a composite value containing the given values. Such a composite value may then be deconstructed and analyzed, typically using pattern matching. An \gls{adt} may have several constructors with different combinations of data, and may also be recursive. This provides a simple but powerful way of expressing rich data structures.

\Glspl{adt} do not exist in Erlang in the same way as they do in Haskell, i.e. with their heavy reliance on constructors. When using pattern matching in Erlang, entities called atoms are instead used to identify different cases. An atom is a literal constant with a name.
