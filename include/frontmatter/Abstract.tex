The primary goal of this thesis is the design and implementation of a Haskell-like language for the Erlang VM \todo{fix real goal}. The name of this new language is Hopper. A big challenge is melding, in the single language, a strong type system with concurrent and parallel primitives.\todo{mention compiler?}

Starting the report in the technical background there is an overview of the history and technical frameworks used during development \todo{stolen from introduction, rephrase?}. %We follow the steps needed to turn high level Hopper code into code runnable on the virtual machine. There is a presentation of the different parts of a compiler explaining the need and use of each. 

The thesis then states what methods was used when developing the language. An agile development with Git as revision control system and Haskell as implementation language for the compiler is described. 

Design and implementation is then covered, going through the compiler pipeline, further explaining the choices made in implementation and how it affected the compiler.

The resulting Hopper language is a clean basic functional programming language with indentation sensitive syntax featuring polymorphic \glspl{adt}, pattern matching and lambdas. The compiler also has a module system and some integration with Erlang. \todo{stolen from results, rephrase?, add thoughts from conclusions!!!}

In conclusion, the project ...

%Supports: Typesafe message passing, higher order functions, easy access to Erlang bifs, datatypes with type arguments (e.g. Maybe, List, Either, tuples), ad-hoc polymorphism in that we can have a function inspect its own type at runtime and do different things dependent on that. That lets you write stuff that is sort of like type classes.


%This report aims to describe the design and implementation of a Haskell like language for the Erlang VM.

\todo{Describe why this is interesting}


%The language will feature a Haskell-like syntax, offer a typesystem
%similar to that of Haskell and expose, in a safe way, the powerful features of
%the Virtual Machine. To utilize the big Erlang ecosystem it will also integrate
%with current OTP and Erlang libraries.
