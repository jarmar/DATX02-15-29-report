\section{The Grammar}

\todo{expressiveness of grammar}

The resulting grammar from the project is a clean basic functional programming language with indentation sensitive syntax featuring polymorphic \glspl{adt}, pattern matching and lambdas.

Additional grammatical features % other word for feature
were planned and designed but not implemented. Most of those features were syntactic sugar (e.g. for lists and tuples), but also syntax for simplifying repetive tasks such as \texttt{IO} sequencing, also known in Haskell as \texttt{do}-notation.
