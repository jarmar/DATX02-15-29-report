\section{Code revision control}

When developing the Hopper language and implementing its compiler, Git \cite{git} was used for code revision control. Revision control systems enable development using several simultaneous contributors. A central repository is used to host the latest version of the code with group members being able to add features locally and push any changes to the central repository when done.

To enable a flexible and parallel development process, different components and features in the project were implemented using branches. When said components and features were believed to be in a usable state, the containing branch was merged into a shared development branch.
