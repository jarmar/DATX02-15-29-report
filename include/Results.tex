\chapter{Results}

The result of the project is the Hopper language and its compiler. The language is a clean basic functional programming language with indentation sensitive syntax featuring polymorphic \glspl{adt}, pattern matching and lambdas. The compiler also has a module system and some integration with Erlang. Not included in the final product is easy access to message passing through send/receive and full Erlang interoperability. The features of each part are presented in more depth below.
