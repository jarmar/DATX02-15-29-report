\chapter{Results}

The result of the project is the Hopper language and its compiler. The language is a clean basic functional programming language with indentation sensitive syntax featuring polymorphic \glspl{adt}, pattern matching and lambdas. The compiler also has a module system and some integration with Erlang. The features of each part are presented in more depth below.
