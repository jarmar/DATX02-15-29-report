\section{Typechecker}

The type checker provides support for polymorphic functions and \glspl{adt}, and hardcodes the type of the \gls{bif} access function \texttt{Prim.apply}\todo{is that the only thing that's hardcoded? aren't bif types also hardcoded?}. In addition, it supports typesafe receive clauses and ad-hoc polymorphism in an experimental form.
