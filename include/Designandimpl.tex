\chapter{Design and Implementation}

This chapter describes the design and implementation of the Hopper language and the Hopper compiler with all its components. There are overviews of each part describing the choices made and the reasoning behind those choices.

When first designing Hopper there was already an outline of what the language should aim to be. The type safety and clean syntax of Haskell combined with the powerful framework for concurrency and parallelism supplied by the Erlang virtual machine were the key features from which Hopper would be built. Within those confines there were further choices as to which features to include, and which to exclude, to make the language relevant and useful.
