\section{Missing features}

The language and compiler has succeeded in implementing type safety run on the Erlang VM. Easy to use syntax is however missing for some key features. Specifically, the group desired that sending/receiving of messages and the spawning of processes would be intuitive and concise. The interoperability with Erlang was also not complete. The initial goals of accessing the concurrency and parallelism from Erlang have thus not been fully met.
