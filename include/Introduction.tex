\chapter{Introduction}

\todo{Assigned to: Björn}

There is a trend toward more type checking, more concurrency, and more parallellism in modern programming languages as seen in Swift\cite{swift} and Rust\cite{rust}. Type checking to manage correctness in ever more complex systems, concurrency to manage large distributed systems and parallellism to utilize the growing number of cores available in computers. There currently exist eminent languages in each of these categories.

\section{Problem}

Each of these concerns have spawned viable solutions, notably Haskell\cite{haskell} for type systems and Erlang\cite{erlang} for concurrency and parallellism. But as far as the group knows there has been few successful attempts at combining these solutions in a language which offer the benefits of an strong type system togheter with the benefits of native concurrent and parallell features. We will take on the challenge of combining the merits of these fields in a new programming language called Hopper endowed with an expressive type system and with native facilities for concurrent and parallell programming. The question that the project aims to answer is whether a prototype for this new language can be implemented in such a way that it is powerful, containing the desired features, and usable.

insight into problems that rise


We think this report might interest the programming language community and serve as a springboard into a more exhaustive attempt at integrating type systems with concurrent and parallell capabillities.

\section{Scope}

As programming language design and implementation is an intricate field of study we will need to limit the scope of the project to fit the limitations of a bachelors thesis. \todo{Prototype focus on type system}

\section{Report overview}

The report outlines following this introductory chapter are first a history and background of the technology framework used. Following this is a chapter explaining the methods and libraries used. Design and implementation explains the algorithms and implementation decisions made developing the prototype. The last three chapters tell what was produced from the project, discuss the product and a summarize a conclusion of the whole project.
