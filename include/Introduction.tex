\chapter{Introduction}

\todo{Assigned to: Björn}

There is a trend toward more type checking and more parallellism in modern programming languages as seen in Swift\cite{swift} and Rust\cite{rust}. Type checking to manage correctness in ever more complex systems and \todo{concurrency, distributet environments} parallellism to utilize the growing number of cores available in computers. There currently exist eminent languages in each of these categories.

\section{Problem (statement?)}

\todo{Explain lack of existing/need for hybrid} We will take on the challenge of combining the merits of these fields in a new programming language called Hopper endowed with an expressive type system and with native facilities for parallell programming. The question that the project aims to answer is whether a prototype for this new language can be implemented in such a way that it is powerful, containing the desired features, and usable.

\section{Purpose}

\todo{användbarhet}

\todo{What we will need to do and problems we might face in design}

\todo{What we will need to do and problems we might face in implementation}

We think this report might interest the programming language community and serve as a springboard into a more exhaustive attempt at integrating type systems with parallell capabillities.

\section{Scope}

As programming language design and implementation is an intricate field of study we will need to limit the scope of the project to fit the limitations of a bachelors thesis. \todo{Prototype focus on type system, Haskell famous for types therefore Haskell-like type system and syntax, Erlang famous for parallellism therefore Erlang VM.
To take advantage of both BEAM's great concurrency model with the safety of 
Haskell's typesystem this project is intended to design and implement a new 
language named Hopper.}

\section{Disposition/Report overview}

The report outlines following this introductory chapter are first a history and background of the technology framework used. Following this are a chapter explaining the methods and libraries used. Design and implementation explains the algorithms and implementation decisions made developing the prototype. The last three chapters tells whats produced from the project, discussion of the product and a summary conclusion of the whole project.
