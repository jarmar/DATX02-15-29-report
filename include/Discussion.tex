ADD RESULTS FIRST AND HAVE DISCUSSION DEPEND ON RESULTS.

\section{Methods discussion}

Agile.
- sprint length
- no daily feedback, mostly weekly meetings
- no scrum master
- start with small subset of language, difficult for type checker (but discuss that difficulty more in implementation discussions, only mention here in relation to scrum sprints)


Git.

- mostly good! 
- branching, not enough merging
- type checker branches (mention but discuss more in implementation?)

Haskell.

- anything to say about use of haskell?

Libraries?


\section{Implementation discussion}

Link to results (which will have talked about what made it in and not).
Discuss why the stuff that didn't make it in didn't.
What choices was made during implementation that could/should have been different?

Type checker branches went too long without merging.
Why two branches in the first place?

Discuss each compiler phase?

Well documented? Tests?




\section{Results discussion}

Not everything made it but...
we aimed for working prototype,
learning was one of the goals,
we have seen some results.
