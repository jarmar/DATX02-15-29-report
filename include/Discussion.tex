\chapter{Discussion}

\todo{Add chapter summary}

%In this section we discuss the results of the project and the methods used during development. 
This section starts by discussing the results of the Hopper project. The implemented features for each compiler part will be listed together with comments on how the features raise the relative strength of the language and compiler. There will also be discussions on how the desired features that did not make it affect the finished prototype. After the results discussion follows sections handling overall code quality and the effects of development methods.

\todo{(FOR ALL COMPONENTS) Talk about features, which are good, which are not so good? Tradeoffs (Consequences of design choices, what was gained, what was "lost")}
