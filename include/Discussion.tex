\chapter{Discussion}

This section starts by discussing the results of the Hopper project. The implemented features for each compiler part will be listed together with comments on how the features raise the relative strength of the language and compiler. There will also be discussions on how the desired features that did not make it affect the finished prototype. After the results discussion follows sections handling overall code quality and the effects of the chosen development methods.
