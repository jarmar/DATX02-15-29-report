**DATX02-15-29 A Haskell-like language on the Erlang VM**  
Protocol, weekly meeting 2015-01-28.  
Location: Room 6209 EDIT building.  
Time: 15.15 - 16.45  
Attendance: Björn, Johan L, Johan W, Liam, David, Jakob, Nick.   
Moderator: Björn Norgren  
Notetaker: Johan Larsson  

● Follow up from last meeting

  Reading:    
Some group members have read Core Erlang and found it very relevant. The book by Simon Peyton-Jones (… : A Tutorial) is good,  
 f.ex. the part about algebraic data types, but we can skip the parts about interpretation for this project.   
Other things mentioned are Elixir, Cloud Haskell, beam specification and the book by Pierce.
  
  Possibility of getting shared latex:
Jakob has had email contact with Arne who is going to try to find a good solution since several groups doing their bachelors thesis have requested this.  
From the email answer Jakob got we suspect Arne did not get our intention to use this for our project planning report and thus will need it shortly.  
Jakob will write another email explaining this.

● Language for the project (Swedish/English)

  The group decides to use English as official language for all group related documents etc.  
Individual logs can be kept in whatever language is preferred by the student.

● File handling. Google drive or Git?
  
  We will start using Git for protocols and other group documents since we get a history of file changes etc.  
Google drive will still be used for larger and/or less important files until we no longer feel the need for it.

  We will make sure that Nick gets access to the google group, google drive and git repositories.

● ”Fleshing out” Haskerl

- We can look at BNF of Haskell and possibly use big parts of it.
- Typed and untyped channels (Typed: send :: chan a -> a -> IO() , Untyped: send :: chan a -> Value -> IO() )
- INTEROPERABLE (easy to spawn processes etc, all BIFs)
- whereis should return a Maybe
- Type classes? Having might be bad for interoperability so maybe start without and if we want to then we might add later
- Modules/error handling. Use try/catch from Core Erlang. (Nothing said on modules)
- Expose as much Erlang stuff as possible (try/catch, default equality etc)
- Possibility of compiling Haskerl from Erlang shell?   
Maybe this is a later feature. Would need compiler written in Erlang or be “self-hosting”.
- Eager/strict since beam is not suited for lazy evaluation.
- Language should be pure with IO monad
- Syntactic sugar? Haskell style? Keep it simple!
- How should Haskell data types map to Erlang?
ex: data Maybe a = Nothing | Just a  
represented as: nothing (atom), {just, X} or possibly {}, {X}.  
What are the priorities? Speed? Ease of use? Writing correct code?
- Type of all Erlang values
- Can we have arbitrary guards in receive? Look at Core Erlang.   
(Erlang has constraints on guards but we might be allowed more arbitrary ones)
- Allow constructors of same name in different data types?
ex: data A = Ok | Fail, data B = Ok | Not_found
or explicit conversions?
- Explicit conversions to/from Erlang or not?
- Project quality management (testing etc)  
We should have test suite of programs showing interesting examples,   
testing specific features etc. When we find a bug we make a program featuring the bug and add to the test suite.

● Project Plan Report (deadline 2015-02-13)

  We divide the report into parts for each group member to be responsible for.  
Having responsibility for something does not mean you can’t ask others for help. The work is divided like this:  
(Look up proper English names for these!)  
Method: Johan WS.  
Background and Purpose: Liam and David.  
Problem and Limitations: Björn and Johan L.  
Timeplan: Jakob.  
  The first draft should be finished by next week’s meeting 2015-02-04.

● Other topics.

  Everybody makes sure to start personal journals and time logs! We need to make sure these are available to Nick and Arne.  
  Each group member should write a small piece of code exemplifying something we want Haskerl to do before the next weekly meeting.

● Relevant dates until next meeting?

  Nothing other than Fackspråk etc. Johan L can’t attend the Fackspråk lecture but will read the slide and be given a summary from attending group members.

Nick cannot attend next weekly meeting due to travels, we will email him the project plan draft.

The meeting room is booked for another three week (by David and Jakob).
