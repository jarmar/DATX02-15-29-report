####Debriefing of half time presentation

It went well!

####Iteration results
 
Some stuff added to grammar.
AST and code generation is working and does not need further attention right now.
Type checking in both branches are seeing progress. Liams version does type checking but not on modules.
The dev-tc branch has no working type checking but will hopefully have that soon.
A merging workshop for the two branches of type checking will be taking place.

It's a bit strange that we have been matched with a group from such a different discipline. How are we supposed to evaluate each others work fully? We will send the other group an e-mail to see how we solve this.
