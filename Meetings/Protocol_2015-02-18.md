###Follow up on last meeting/workshop


####First iteration results


####Lexer/parser

First iteration does what it is supposed to do. Some bnfc generated files will not be included in gitignore since small changes has been made.


####Abstract syntax

Work has been done on collected function definitions. Suggestion made to wait with introducing separate ASTs to lessen work in case of changes in bnfc grammar etc. But having a simple AST would help work in later phases. Group seems to agree that separate ASTs are wanted.

Extend to have multiple argument functions.

####Type checker

Reading has been done in preparation for coming iterations where type checker will be included.

####Extra step?

Uncurry exported funs, curry imported funs.
SEE: The worker/wrapper transformation.

Some examples of what we might want to do:

f x y => App (App f x) y

let g = f x in g y 

A -> (B -> C) => A B -> C

####Code generation

Good progress has been made. Not everything is included yet (lambdas, applications) but a lot of stuff that we need for now is. Some assumptions made, included in header comments.

####Integration

Code generator should be able to assume everything is typed etc, fixed by previous passes.

###Next iteration?

- Lexing/Parsing: -

- Type checking: Liam and Björn.

- Code generation: Johan WS.

- Integration (uncurrying): David.

- AST/Desugaring: Jakob and Johan L.

###Other items

Push branches even though stuff isn't complete, as long as it's not in a branch where it breaks the pipeline. Group members can look through (and possibly give comments).

David will read up on Fackspråk stuff to plan for booking a meeting.

###Any important upcoming events?



###When will we meet again? Where?

A session Friday feb 20th 10-14 handling the AST stuff.
Weekly Meeting 2015-02-25, 15.15.
