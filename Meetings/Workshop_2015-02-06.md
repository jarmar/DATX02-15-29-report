##DATX02-15-29 A Haskell-like language on the Erlang VM  
###Protocol, workshop 2015-02-06.  
Location: Room 6205 EDIT building.  
Time: 10.00 - 
Attendance: Björn, Johan L, Johan W, Liam (Late), David, Jakob (Late).  
(Nick away on travels)

Moderator: Björn Norgren
Notetaker: Johan Larsson

### Planning report

Group members updates their draft according to comments given on Git commits (in the docs repo).
After an update is done Johan WS will make a unified document and proof read with possible help from Johan L.
Updates should be done latest sunday 2015-02-08.

### Workshop

####efi

From Davids example code, looks like a good starting point.
How do we differentiate between Haskerl and Erlang imports/exports?

#### Import/export

Give type/name for exports. Import/export Erlang functions with name/type declarations.
Import module / module functions.
Header file-style? Preferably not, keep code in module. 

####significant white space

See style from Haskell.


#### Erlang BIFs

Interaction with Core Erlang.
Need to consider naming.

No polymorphic function with differing arity.

Implicitly import all the BIFs?
Take everything from the erlang module?

Possibly later goal.
Start by making our example programs work, import manually in the meantime.

#### receive

Safe/unsafe receive? Enforce typed receive?
Typed/untyped receive channels (see sendChan/receiveChan in Cloud Haskell)?
sendChan :: SC a -> a -> IO(), receiveChan :: RC a -> IO a. newtype SC a = SC Pid... (how are channels shared? risks?).

Keep them unsafe? How can we enforce type safety?

Or do

receive (3 :: Integer) -> doSomething
        (x :: a)       -> doOtherStuff




receive
    Just n :: Maybe Int -> to_float(n+1)
    a      :: float     -> a/2

(or just infer types?)

Or

receive :: (PID, String)
    (_,msg) ->


And/or have

unsafeReceive ('ok', x) -> x
               atom     -> error "msg"


should receive be able to receive single type or several different types?

#### lambda expressions

A given.

#### do notation

#### partial application

should be easy (?), use lambdas?


#### (generic) algebraic data types

See implementing functional languages: a tutorial (SPJ), chapter 1.3.
Maybe not to start but quite early.



### Name discussion

Name after some mathematician? (As Haskell/Erlang ?)

Hopper? (from grace hopper, has H(askell), ER(lang), and hopper sounds nice).





### Small subset of the language, a starting point

First program to write a compiler for:

- - - -

module Name ( expr  
            , ...  
            ) where


expr :: String  
expr = "hello world"


f :: Int -> Int -> Int  
f = \a b -> a+b

g :: Int  
g = f 1 2

-- comment  
{- comment -}

- - - -
Suggestion made to write our own Core language.  
Group decides to do this at a later stage of the project if it is needed.






### Grammar (BNFC)





entrypoints Module;


comment "--";
comment "{-" "-}";

token Id ( lower ( digit | letter | '_' | '\'' )*);

token UpperId ( upper ( digit | letter | '_' | '\'' )* );


token IdParam ( lower ( digit | letter | '_' | '\'' )* );
terminator nonempty IdParam "";

token IdExport ( lower ( digit | letter | '_' | '\'' )* ); 
separator IdExport ",";

Module . Module ::= "module" UpperId "(" [IdExport] ")" "where" [Def];



DSig . Def ::= Id "::" Type;
DFun . Def ::= Id "=" Exp;
terminator Def "";


TName . Type ::= Id;
separator nonempty Type "->";

ELambda  . Exp1 ::= "\\" [IdParam] "->" Exp1;
EString  . Exp2 ::= String;
EInteger . Exp2 ::= Integer;
EApp     . Exp2 ::= Exp1 [Exp];
terminator Exp "";
coercions Exp 2;
