## Purpose

The overarching idea with the project is to design and implement an alternative language, named Hopper, to the Erlang language on top of the Erlang Virtual Machine. The language will feature a Haskell-like syntax, offer a typesystem similar to that of Haskell and expose, in a safe way, the powerful features of the Virtual Machine. To utilize the big Erlang ecosystem it will also integrate with current OTP and Erlang libraries. 

The purpose of this bachelor project is for the group to learn about functional programming, compilers and how a typesystem works and is constructed.
