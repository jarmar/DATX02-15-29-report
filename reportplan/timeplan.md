##Time plan

As explained in the method section, the group will use an iterative development process.

The purpose of the first iteration is to get a handle on the tools that we will be using as well as the process itself, and will run for about two weeks. Less focus is put on the language, whose main goal is to be as simple as possible in order to not obscure other difficulties.

After that a second, fuller, iteration will be timed so that it will be finished about the time of the half time presentation in the course.

After these two initial versions, an additional number of iterations will follow. Their individual length and scope will be determined based on the testing and analysis of previous iterations.

This is illustrated in the attached Gantt chart.
