# Personal log

### Fall 2014 to 2015-01-19 Pre project
Thought about entering a project idea. Didn't.
Got the project list. Got excited about Haskell on Erlang VM.
Applied for the project. Got assigned to the project.
Thought about preemptively study the topic. Thought better and decided it was best to not meet the group with preconceived notions.
Startup information recieved very late.

### 2015-01-20 to 2015-01-27 Confusing
Confusing startup lecture.
First meeting with the group. Seems like we are on the same level.
Second meeting with the group. Talked about the project, listed some resources and decided some roles for the group members for the report plan phase.
Surveyed litterature and read up on Core Erlang.
Wrote agenda for next meeting.

### 2015-01-28 to 2015-02-03 Less confusing but boring work
Meeting. Decided who writes what in the report plan. Tried to get a broad discussion about the project going, but it quickly degenerated into details.
Difficult to get going on the report. Details are fuzzy and at this stage it mostly feels like busy work.
Did some more reading.
Wrote agenda for next meeting.

### 2015-02-04 to 2015-02-06
Commented progress on the report plan.
Participated in workshop. Agreed upon a first small program we should be able to compile. Started on the grammar.

### 2015-02-07 to 2015-03-09
Working hard on the type checker. It has been a slow start, but we are gaining momentum now.
