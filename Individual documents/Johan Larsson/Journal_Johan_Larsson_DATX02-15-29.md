###Week 1.

Lots of administrative stuff to fix and trying to get a good start with the project. Group seems very capable and willing. Trying to read stuff and set up computer + laptop to run BNFC and whatever else seems relevant for the project. Took on role of notetaker for initial work phase (up until project plan report deadline) and we'll see if that changes afterwards. Reading is a bit difficult since I don't have a clear picture of what we will be doing in practice and can't evaluate the literature in any good way (and reading all the books at once seems a bit much). The PLT course (and course book) feels relevant and I'll try to freshen up my Erlang in lack of better reading. Fackspråk lecture times clash with PLT lectures and I'm not sure if I can go. Will discuss with other group members how to solve.

###Week 2 - thursday.

Group dynamics are working well. I feel I'm a bit after on the reading, others are discussing and evaluating some of the literature Nick mentioned. Have plans to study during the weekend to catch up. Responsibility of writing the project plan report were divided between group members by the sections to be written. Me and Björn will write Problem and Limitations. Group agreed that everyone will write some code displaying functionality we want from "Haskerl". Good idea since it will start manifesting the stuff we have been talking about. Not sure what to write since I'm a bit confused with what we're doing and my Erlang knowledge is still not where it should be but I've got Björn to talk to and get help.

###Week 2 - sunday.

Nice to have a few more hours of reading. Read Core Erlang stuff and beginning chapters of many of the recommended books to see what I found relevant. Next I need to figure out which chapters are aimed at what we're doing. I feel that I understand the things I'm reading but I'm not quite sure how to apply these things. Will probably suggest some kind of less formal discussion (not weekly meeting) about the project so the group can agree on what we want to do (and I can get a clearer picture of the coming steps).
