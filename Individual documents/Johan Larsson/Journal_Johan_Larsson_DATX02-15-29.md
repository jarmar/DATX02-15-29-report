###Week 1.

Lots of administrative stuff to fix and trying to get a good start with the project. Group seems very capable and willing. Trying to read stuff and set up computer + laptop to run BNFC and whatever else seems relevant for the project. Took on role of notetaker for initial work phase (up until project plan report deadline) and we'll see if that changes afterwards. Reading is a bit difficult since I don't have a clear picture of what we will be doing in practice and can't evaluate the literature in any good way (and reading all the books at once seems a bit much). The PLT course (and course book) feels relevant and I'll try to freshen up my Erlang in lack of better reading. Fackspråk lecture times clash with PLT lectures and I'm not sure if I can go. Will discuss with other group members how to solve.

###Week 2 - thursday.

Group dynamics are working well. I feel I'm a bit after on the reading, others are discussing and evaluating some of the literature Nick mentioned. Have plans to study during the weekend to catch up. Responsibility of writing the project plan report were divided between group members by the sections to be written. Me and Björn will write Problem and Limitations. Group agreed that everyone will write some code displaying functionality we want from "Haskerl". Good idea since it will start manifesting the stuff we have been talking about. Not sure what to write since I'm a bit confused with what we're doing and my Erlang knowledge is still not where it should be but I've got Björn to talk to and get help.

###Week 2 - sunday.

Nice to have a few more hours of reading. Read Core Erlang stuff and beginning chapters of many of the recommended books to see what I found relevant. Next I need to figure out which chapters are aimed at what we're doing. I feel that I understand the things I'm reading but I'm not quite sure how to apply these things. Will probably suggest some kind of less formal discussion (not weekly meeting) about the project so the group can agree on what we want to do (and I can get a clearer picture of the coming steps).

###Week 3.

Week has been spent mostly working on the planning report and reading. A workshop held friday was very helpful. Discussing the language and writing some stuff down felt like we got a proper start and something to do besides just reading/planning.

###Week 4.

Working on the planning report went ok and the finalized document looks nice. The second phase has started and it is exciting to be doing some actual writing beside the research. Work on PLT course takes some time when deadline is coming up but even though it takes away from the bachelors work a bit it still feels useful (since the subjects overlap quite a bit).

###Week 5.

For this iteration (one week) I was assigned to working on the AST along with Jakob. Since the design of the AST would affect later steps we decided to have a small workshop Friday together with Björn and Liam who are working on the type checker. The workshop went ok and we agreed on the functionality we wanted from the AST to start (but kept it at a manageable size to get something working). Everybody seems to be good at taking initiatives and adding code to the project which I haven't started doing yet. Since I'm not used to this kind of project I'm a bit slow to start. After more reading and catching up with what everyone has written I will see if I can add something. I sometimes assume I have to see the entire solution in my head before I can start coding. We do after all have the version control system with branches to be able to test stuff out.
