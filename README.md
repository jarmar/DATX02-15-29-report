# DATX02-15-29-report
Final report for the Haskerl bachelors thesis

## Things to do this afternoon
 - Go through glossary
 - Look through texts for potential glossary words
 - isn't -> is not...
 - Language review
 - Use of commas. (some of these can be skipped sometimes)
   1. The first, second, and third element of a list. (listing, use Oxford comma?)  
   2. Hopper is cool, and the compiler is nice. (with conjunction)  
   3. As a prototype, Hopper is successful. (introductory part)  
   4. Designing Hopper, and its compiler, was super duper fun. (parenthetical part)  
      (taken from http://grammar.ccc.commnet.edu/grammar/commas.htm)

## Build instructions
TODO: work in progress

Run

1. `pdflatex Main.tex` to generate glossary files.
2. `makeglossaries Main` to create glossary.
3. `pdflatex Main.tex` again to complete the document.

## Alternative build with latexmk (should be included in your latex installation)
Create a .latexmkrc in your home directory containing

    add_cus_dep('glo', 'gls', 0, 'run_makeglossaries');
    add_cus_dep('acn', 'acr', 0, 'run_makeglossaries');

    sub run_makeglossaries {
      if ( $silent ) {
        system "makeglossaries -q '$_[0]'";
      }
      else {
        system "makeglossaries '$_[0]'";
      };
    }

    push @generated_exts, 'glo', 'gls', 'glg';
    push @generated_exts, 'acn', 'acr', 'alg';
    $clean_ext .= ' %R.ist %R.xdy';

Run `latexmk -g -f -pdf -silent Main.tex` to generate pdf
or  `latexmk -C` to clean out files
